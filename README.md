# FLAMES

If you are a 90’s kid, you definitely would not require any assistance on this. You are already a pro !!!
If you say you were a good kid back then in your school days, then let me explain you. FLAMES is an innovative game founded by a desperately single 90’s kid. This game would not employ you much, but your name and your crush’s name.
Getting back to school days once again!!! Take a sheet of paper, write your name and your crush’s name. Cancel off all the common characters you both have in your names. Now count the remaining uniques characters. Write the word FLAMES. To expand FLAMES, F stands for Friends, L stands for Love, A - Affection, M - Marriage , E - Enemies, S - Siblings. Cancel the character from the word FLAMES that comes as the unique character count.
For example, if there are 10 unique characters in your names, F L A M E S F L A M - come as the 10th character. Strike it off, You and your crush would not get married. Now your Flames would have F L A E S. Repeating the same, F L A E S F L A E S - Strike the S. And repeat the same till you get the final character. That is your ‘so called Flames’ relationship with your crush.

# Your role:
* Fork the repo (Fork icon in GitHub and copy the link)
* Clone the repo (In your GitBash, git clone *copied link*
* Work on the Edit files using eclipse.

The common errors you might face while working on the starter code, are:
On opening the code in Eclipse, by default you’d have errors. It is due to system library mismatch. That is instead of your system library, it would detect the system library of the person who has created the started code.
How can you overcome this error?
1. Right click on the project —> Build Path 
2. You’d see errors spotted in the JRE System Library.
3. Click JRE System Library and click Remove.
4. Now that you have removed the JRE System Library, you will have to add your system library.
5. Click Add variable… and click the JRE System Library.
Now you have added your System Library. Check your program, it would be as clean as crystal(without red lines).

# Iteration 1: Name Matcher
The first trial of flames would be to cancel off all the common characters in your names and count the unique characters in you (and your partner)

# Iteration 2: Relationship Status: Not Single
Here you would be flying with the relationship obtained from the game

All righty!!!, I know you will be cheeky with the application, by trying all different combinations of the same names until you get a desired relationship status. Do not forget to upload the project in GitHub.
